 The Internet is a large and complex aggregation of network hardware, 
 connected together by gateways.  Tracking the route one's packets follow 
 (or finding the miscreant gateway that's discarding your packets) can be 
 difficult.  (from traceroute(8))

+.sp
 The only mandatory parameter is the target host name or IP number.  
 Options toggle the display of more interesting data or change the variables
 of the trace itself.  The (-E/-e) adaptive option tries several combinations 
 of TCP states (changing flags inside the probes it sends) in order to improve 
 the chances of a successful trace and expose stateful packet filters.
-.Pp
+.sp
 Other options are:
-.Bl -tag -width Ds
-.It Fl d Ar dport
-Set
-.Ar dport
-as the destination TCP port of the probes LFT generates.  Default is 80.  This option is useful to see if packets follow a different route based on protocol destination, a likely scenario when load balancers or proxies are involved.  This option may also bypass less sophisticated packet filter configurations.
-.It Fl s Ar sport
-Set
-.Ar sport
-as the origin TCP port of the probes LFT generates.  Default is 53.  This option is useful to see if packets follow a different route based on protocol source. This option may also bypass less sophisticated packet filter configurations.
-.It Fl z
-Automatically select a pseudo-random source port.  This option may be useful if your local
-packet filter or proxy doesn't allow you to use source ports outside of the dymanic range allocation.
-.It Fl m Ar min
-Set 
-.Ar min
-as the minimum number of re-attempts to send per host.  Default is 1 unless adaptive
-(-E) mode is used.
-.It Fl M Ar max
-Set 
-.Ar max
-as the maximum number of re-attempts to send per host.  Default is 3.
-.It Fl a Ar ahead
-Set 
-.Ar ahead
-as the number of hops forward to query before waiting for a response.  Default
-is 5.
-.It Fl c Ar scatter ms
-Set 
-.Ar scatter ms
-as the minimum number of milliseconds to wait between sending probes.  Default
-is 20.
-.It Fl t Ar timeout ms
-Set 
-.Ar timeout ms
-as the maximum number of milliseconds to wait before assuming a probe was 
-lost/discarded.  Default is 1000.
-.It Fl l Ar min ttl
-Set 
-.Ar min tll
-as the minimum TTL (time-to-live) on outgoing probes (essentially, the 
-first hop in the line that you want to display).  Default is 1.
-.It Fl q Ar ISN
-Set 
-.Ar ISN
-as the ISN (initial sequence number) of the first probe.  If unset, one will be
-automatically generated using a pseudo-random, time-seeded algorithm.
-.It Fl L Ar length
-Set 
-.Ar length
-as the size of probe packets in bytes.  This includes layer-3 and layer-4 headers, but
-does not include layer-2 headers.  For example, setting the length to 1500 would create
-a 1500-byte probe packet which would result in a 1514-byte frame on an Ethernet network.
-.It Fl D Ar device
-Set 
-.Ar device
-as the network device or address to receive traffic.  (e.g., "en1" or "1.2.3.4")  If unset, 
-.Nm
-will attempt to determine and acquire the appropriate interface based on routing.
-.It Fl f Ar device
-Set 
-.Ar device
-as the network device or address to transmit traffic.  (e.g., "en1" or "1.2.3.4")  If unset, 
-.Nm
-will attempt to determine and acquire the appropriate interface based on routing.
-This serves to operate 
-.Nm
-in a passive mode where you may transmit from a (potentially) spoofed IP address on one
-interface, yet receive on another. This allows you to trace from a different
-IP address whose traffic you can see in order to intercept replies.
-.It Fl H Ar ttl
-Set 
-.Ar ttl
-as the maximum TTL, essentially the maximum route traversal distance in 
-hops.  Default is 30.
